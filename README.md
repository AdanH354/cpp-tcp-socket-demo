# C++ TCP/IP Socket Demo

This project demonstrates a simple **client-server application in C++** using TCP sockets on Linux.  
It was developed as a demonstration project to showcase networking, multithreading, and debugging skills.

## Features
- TCP socket programming in C++
- Basic client-server communication (request/response)
- Multi-threaded server to handle multiple clients
- Error handling and debugging with `gdb`
- Clean, object-oriented code style

## Requirements
- Linux (tested on Ubuntu/Fedora)
- g++ (GCC) or clang
- Makefile

## Build & Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdanH354/cpp-tcp-socket-demo.git
cd cpp-tcp-socket-demo
